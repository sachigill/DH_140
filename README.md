## Potential Project Ideas

### Article + Visualization of interest
[Urban Planning](https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/1um18ajd/release/2)
This article interests me because it talks about how urban scientists should really examine ideological values when collecting data and analyzing it. It also discusses specific ethical issues on just only relying on data. It talks about making sure to upflift those voices that are underrepresented and to make datasets open to public, in order to help create more fair and equitable urban development policies.

I think these visualizations would be really cool to learn how to make in python as I feel these types of visualizations are able to effectively showcase data in a understandable and appealing way.

### Humanities topics I would like to investigate

-  Urban Planning
-  Census Data
-  Public Health

### Ideas from Curated Datasets

| Dataset        | Description           | Link  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Women Elected Officials      | Showcases data on elected women officials, including details like name, year, state, etc. We can use coding to analyze women's representation in government over time and also see if geogrpahic locations and the number of elected women officials are correlated. | [Dataset 1](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/CFPBRI/ER5Q7X&version=1.0&toolType=PREVIEW) |
| Dublin trees      | This showcases data about trees in Fingal, a county in Ireland and includes data like town, species, height, tree condition, etc. Coding can be used in combination with other datasets to understand the relationship between certain aspects of tree data with environmetal factors like pollution or climate change.     |   [Dataset 2](https://data.smartdublin.ie/dataset/trees/resource/47d28489-44e5-4eee-93a8-a31e110f6cce) |
